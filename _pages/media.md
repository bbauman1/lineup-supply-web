### What is the app and how does it work
LineupSupply takes an image provided by the user, usually music festival posters, and creates a playlist of the Artist names in the image. This works by using Apple's Vision framework to pull any text out of the image. The provided image never leaves the users device. A Spotify account is needed to use the app, but Spotify Premium is not required to create playlists. There is also a Discover feature where you users see what other people are making in the app.

### Features

#### Free
- An unlimited number of playlists can be created.
- Playlists created by other users of the app are shown in the Discover tab. Users can opt-out of their playlists being shared.

#### Premium
A 1 time in-app purchase of $1.99 unlocks additional features such as:
- Custom app icons
- Music recommendations - LineupSupply will find similar artists to the ones found in your image
- More customizations such as controlling the number of songs per artist, playlist description, and song sorting options.
